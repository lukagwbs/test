SQL CHALLENGES 4

*******************************************************************************
*******************************************************************************

In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
	- LIKE (%, _)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In SQL we can have many databases, they will show up in the schemas list
We must first define which database we will be working with. */

USE publications;

/*******************************************************************************
LIKE

Here we will also learn to use some wild card characters:

(You can ignore 'Wildcard Characters in MS Access'
You need to look at the section 'Wildcard Characters in SQL Server')

/* 1. Select all books from the table title that contain the word "cooking"
   in its title */

SELECT *

WHERE T.title LIKE "%cooking%";

SELECT *  
FROM titles
WHERE title LIKE '%cooking%';


-- 2. Select all titles that start with the word "The"

SELECT *
FROM titles
WHERE title LIKE "the%";

/* 3. Select the full names (first and last name) of authors whose last name
   starts with "S" */

SELECT au_fname AS first_name, au_lname AS last_name 
FROM authors 
WHERE au_lname LIKE 'S%';

/* 4. Select the name and address of all stores located in an Avenue
   (its address ends with "Ave.") */

SELECT stor_name,stor_address
FROM stores
WHERE stor_address LIKE '%Ave.';

/* 5. Select the name and address of all stores located in an Avenue or in a
   Street (address ended in "St.") */

SELECT stor_name, stor_address
   FROM stores
   WHERE stor_address LIKE "%Ave." 
   OR stor_address LIKE "%St.";

/* 6. Look at the "employee" table (select all columns to explore the raw data):
   Find a pattern that reveals whether an employee is Female or Male.
   Select all female employees. */

SELECT * FROM employee;

SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE emp_id LIKE '%F';

/* 7. Select the first and last names of all male employees whose name starts
   with "P". */

SELECT fname, lname
FROM employee
WHERE emp_id LIKE '%M' AND fname LIKE 'p%';

/* 8. Select all books that have an "ing" in the title, with at least 4 other
   characters preceding it. For example, 'cooking' has 4 characters before the
   'ing', so this should be included; 'sewing' has only 3 characters before the
   'ing', so this shouldn't be included. */


SELECT * FROM titles WHERE title LIKE '____%ing%';

/*
In the exercises below you will need to use the following clauses:
    - IN (NOT IN)
    - BETWEEN (AND)

*/


/*******************************************************************************
IN

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_in.asp
*******************************************************************************/

/* 9. Select the name and state of all stores located in either California (CA)
   or Oregon (OR) */

SELECT state,stor_name
FROM stores
WHERE state IN ('CA', 'OR');

/* 10. Using "IN", select all titles of type "psychology", "mod_cook" and
"trad_cook" */

SELECT title, type
FROM titles
WHERE type IN ('psychology', 'mod_cook', 'trad_cook');

/* 11. Select all the authors from the author table that do not come from the
cities Salt Lake City, Ann Arbor, and Oakland. */

SELECT *
FROM authors
WHERE city NOT IN ("Salt Lake City", "Ann Arbor", "Oakland");

SELECT  *
FROM authors
WHERE city NOT LIKE 'Salt Lake City'
AND city NOT LIKE 'Ann Arbor'
AND city NOT LIKE 'Oakland';

/* The differences between =, LIKE and IN

= :   takes a single value to look for and matches only the exact value.

LIKE: takes a single to look for and allows wildcards (%, _) to match patterns
      in different positions.

IN :  takes many values to look for, such as a list of values, but does not
      work with the wildcards (%, _). */
